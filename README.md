# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to support the Pewlett Hackard organization in organizing and anlyzing employee data in the wake of thousands of their employees reaching retirement age. Pewlett Hackard is looking to address this in two ways: first, by offering retirement packages for those who meet eligibility requirements and second, transitioning employees nearing retirement into a Part Time Mentorship program to support with the turnover of thousands of employees in new roles. This analysis used SQL to Query the existing Database containing employee information dating back to when the company was orignally created. Based on the employe data, this analysis provides a csv. file detailing the number of retiring employees by title as well as employees eligible for the Mentorship Program.
